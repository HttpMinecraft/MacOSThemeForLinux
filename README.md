# MacOSThemeForLinux
A pack I made for a complete theme for macos has sound to

#Install
1. sudo add-apt-repository universe
2. sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool
3. apt search gnome-shell-extension

#Install Files
Put a . in the begining of all the folder in the root of the folder
.themes
.icons
.sounds
once you done that drag all the folders into your home dir (/home/USERNAME) this wont work on the root account
